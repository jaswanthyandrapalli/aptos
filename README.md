Token Registry System
Project Description
The Token Registry System is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that provides a comprehensive solution for tracking, registering, and verifying token contracts. This system serves as a central repository where token creators can register their contracts, providing transparency and legitimacy to the token ecosystem.

The smart contract enables users to register their token contracts with essential metadata including name, symbol, contract address, and ownership information. Each registered token is timestamped and includes a verification status, creating a reliable database of legitimate tokens within the ecosystem.

Project Vision
Our vision is to create a trusted, decentralized registry that enhances the security and transparency of the token ecosystem on Aptos. By providing a standardized way to register and verify token contracts, we aim to:

Reduce Token Fraud: Help users identify legitimate tokens and avoid scam projects
Increase Transparency: Provide public access to token information and verification status
Establish Trust: Create a reputation system for token creators and projects
Facilitate Discovery: Enable easy discovery of new and verified token projects
Support Ecosystem Growth: Provide infrastructure that supports the healthy growth of the Aptos DeFi ecosystem
